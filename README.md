# OS-Assignment-2

In this assignment, we are implementing the Banker's algorithm to check if the system is safe and if so the safe sequence will be outputted.

The Banker's Algorithm


In this program, we have a input file of numbers. The first and second number are the # of resources and the available. Then with the functins defined as a 2-d array. it reads the number then run through the algorithm
